                <h2>Jayd</h2>
                <h2>aka, "Bee"</h2>
                <P>I'm a software engineering major, I hope to find a job that will let me travel a lot.</P>
                <P>I enjoy the study of world religions, languages, and cultures. I also write stories, I finished my first novel in middle school. (It's very bad.)</P>
                <P>My favorite thing about BYUI is the 2nd floor study space in the STC. It is just the right temperature with just the right lighting. If you find me there, don't bother me. I am studying.</P>
                <P>I am pursuing my Bachelorette's degree. University wasn't in my life plan, so I am proud to have come this far.</P>
                <P>I have been a member of the Church my entire life. My favorite quote from Thomas Monson is, "We must not let our passion destroy our dreams." </P>
