                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The elusive Lion Shark is a newly recognized species native to the North East Canadian islands. As to how it appeared there is still under investigation, as well as the unique properties and attributes of this species. From our current research, they are incredibly rare and live on their own instead of in packs, although they retain the keystone predator instincts that define both of it's primary species. The Lion Shark seems to contain DNA from both animals, but this is expressed differently depending on their territory- either the aquatic, or terrestrial variant. </p>

            <section class ="habitat">
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>The Lion Shark, remarkably, does not share similar habitats with its genetic contributors, leading to a less biased study of how these creatures operate and behave. Although one is a land and the other an ocean variant, they both favor the same geographic regions on the North East coast of the American continent. It cannot be stated conclusively that this is their area of nativity due to the combined genetic factors of their original distinct animals coming from other regions, but we are theorizing currently that the mechanism that unlocked this unique genetic expression remains isolated within that territory. Among the forests and icy glaciers of the North Atlantic, we are beginning to find even rarer combinations and species patterns. </p>

        <section class = "etymology">
            <h3>Etymology</h3>
            <p>The "lion" portion of the name is taken directly from it's genetic counterpart after the Greek "leo". The "shark" portion comes from it's modern day relative, the humble shark. There were other ideas pitched including the "fish of fur and terrors," however, with the rise of so many new species, it was decided to remain as straightforward and accurate as possible.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="taxonomy">
            <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
            <p>This species was, admittedly very difficult to classify. It is considered a separate species from both lions and sharks because those two animals cannot reproduce together. To our current research, however, the lion shark is capable of mating with either of the genetic family it shares. At this point in time, it is unknown how the genetics are shared between the descendents of the shark or the lion parent- whether the offspring will continue to carry the genetic information with both species, or realign with it's most native origin. A fascinating note is that the lion traits expressed within the aquatic variant tend to be mostly vistigial, while the shark traits on the land variant also become vistigial in suit of their environment. We are also investigating as to whether there is greater genetic similarity between the strange animals that share hybrid traits, rather than the DNA of the purebred contributor species.</p>

        <section class ="description">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>There seem to be two dominant variants. The first is a land based animal with a mammilian body, including four legs, fur, and claws. It seems to be shaggier and more flexible than a traditional lion, but shares a remarkable amount of DNA with it as of yet. The heads of these land-dwelling variants are similar to ocean sharks, with rough skin and expendable teeth. They are incredibly fast, and frankly, terrifying.</p>
            <p>The second variant is the aquatic version. It has the body of a shark, complete with fins, gills, and a rough leathery exterior. The head seems to be mostly lion, and the mature males grow manes. The density of hair in the aquatic mammals appears to differ from their land parent counterparts. It is unknown whether their teeth can be replaced. The aquatic type is much more friendly and docile than the land creature.</p>

        <section class = "conservation">
            <h3>Conservation</h3>
            <p>A number of threats are already posed to this new species. It's remarkable that they were even able to appear at all, given the low quantities of their favored food source, the Bluefin Tuna. They also have extremely negative responses to lighthouses, and country music, oddly enough. It is unknown if these will pose a threat to their psychological wellbeing at this stage, but it is hypothesized given the intensity of their reactions. </p>

        <section class ="interaction">
            <h3>Interactions with Humans</h3>
            <p>A lot is still underway into investigating this species. We only learned how fast they were after Todd took the picture of the one in the river. He nearly got his right hand bitten off.</p>

        <section class="culture">
            <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
            <p>While these creatures are relatively new in terms of science, ancient cultures with technologies long lost to the modern day have acknowledged the existence of many seemingly mystical creatures composed of various pieces. We are commencing research to see if the Lion Shark may have had a part in the past with a relationship such as this.</p>
