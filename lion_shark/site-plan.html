      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> I designed this website specifically to bring awareness to the illusive ‘Lion Shark’. By building interactive and informative websites that feature information about both wildlife and wild spaces, I hope to encourage and invite people to participate in nurturing and protecting them. If you’re looking for an effective way to contribute, this website is the starting place to learn more and do more. Contrary to many animal indexes, however, not all of the ones featured here (and namely, the Lion Shark) are real! Bizzare elements will be both included and disclosed, with the goal of having the viewer think more critically about their connection to wildlife and wildspaces. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The site's target audience are teenagers and adults who are fond of animals, want to know more about them, and are interested in donating time or money to become more acquainted with various species and to help protect them. Additionally, the nature of the site won't be too complex for younger kids. Even though they won't be able to donate yet, it's a good place for them to invest their interests. Ultimately, this is a learning platform specifically featuring creatures bizzare enough to pique anyone's interest. However, this is not with the intention to trick them into thinking that some animals are real- but to more strongly appreciate the ones that do exist.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        This page is the informational index for the insubstantial “lion-shark”, the inspiration behind the face of this project. Visitors will come to this site either out of curiosity or confusion and be met with a large presentation of information about this hypothetical creature. Readers will then understand why the awkward infusion of the shark and the lion was chosen, and be encouraged to bridge connections over material that would otherwise have no association, allowing them to expand both their creativity and awareness for more of the world outside of them.

      <h3>About Our Institute</h3>
      <p>
        In more candid terms, this page explains the purpose of the project and the context of what I am hoping to accomplish through the use of this satirical medium. There will be an index of strange and fantastic creatures that actually do exist, as well as an invitation to act, either through further learning or donation, to help preserve them. I think the use of satire is critical to the success of this project. Many campaigns rely on the emotional appeal of the contributors to get them to act, but the flaw here is that people already have a large amount of emotional energy committed to the things they care about, and this is not easily transferred to new spheres. Rather than seeking pity, I think people need to have the chance to grow into caring for things through increased learning, in a way that enhances both themselves and what they hope to protect. This is what distinguishes my site from other animal awareness campaigns, in the way it benefits the mind of the viewer, rather than just taking from them.

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        This page is a support for the world-building aspect of the creatures that might exist within the Lion Shark universe. They are highly scientific drawings of awkwardly fused creatures, designed for both their appeal and intrigue. Each one will be complete with the Latin naming of its species, and a short summary of its key qualities. For the sake of finishing within the deadline, the Lion Shark is the only animal’s profile that will be accessible and completed, but this will give readers a chance to exercise their imagination about the nature and behavior of the others. There will be familiar traits to draw readers in, fused with newer and more abstract ideas that will keep them thinking.
